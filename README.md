## Capstone Project Background 
Food freshness is one of the main parameters in assessing the sustainability of its quality. Food quality is closely related to the freshness of food ingredients, which impacts on flavor, aroma, texture, as well as our health and safety. The choice of fresh ingredients is not only to fulfill culinary satisfaction, but also to ensure that the body receives the best nutrition. Food freshness reflects optimal farming and distribution practices, reducing the risk of contamination and illness that can arise from improper handling.

Focusing on the freshness of food can support the improvement of personal quality of life and the creation of a sustainable food system. In the modern era of technology, innovative solutions such as Fresheats digitize the activity of checking the freshness of food. Fresheats provides information about the freshness of food ingredients and utilizes scanning technology for rapid quality assessment. This approach is not only practical but also supports a healthy and sustainable lifestyle in the digital age.

## Documentation
The Freshness Detector called FreshEats is designed to assist users in determining whether food ingredients are fresh or not. This machine learning project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the MobileNet architecture. The model is built using Keras and the TensorFlow framework. The trained model is then converted into a TensorFlow Lite file and imported into the Android Studio project.
Features

- Freshness Detection: Determine the freshness of food ingredients using advanced machine learning techniques.
- MobileNet Architecture: Benefit from the efficiency of the MobileNet architecture for streamlined performance.
- TensorFlow Integration: Leverage the power of TensorFlow for robust and scalable machine learning.
- TensorFlow Lite Compatibility: Enjoy the flexibility of a TensorFlow Lite file for seamless Android Studio integration.
- Firebase Real-time Connection: Ensure real-time connectivity using Firebase for dynamic data updates.
- Data Buffer Mechanism: Implement a data buffering mechanism to handle situations where an internet connection is unavailable.
